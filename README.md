Problem
“Provide an efficient and accurate method of recording and reporting student attendance.”
The project will involve the development of a Software System that runs on an Android device to allow effective monitoring of student attendance. The developed application will be able to read data through the built-in camera in order to identify individual students. This data will then be processed, recorded and when necessary used in the production of summary reports.
