Apologies for the poor layout of the directories in this file - first time using Git and would do
it differently next time round. Each folder is a completed sprint with a certain number
of features, some of which did or did not make it into the final app. To keep my options 
open for as long as possible, I seperated each out into a directory within this repository.
