Git copies of master's uni project, for more info visit coderwurst.com
FINAL VERSION is completed project
Apologies for the poor layout of the directories in this file - first time using Git and 
have learnt a lot since. Each folder is a completed sprint with a certain number
of features, some of which did or did not make it into the final app. To keep my options 
open for as long as possible, I kept these sprints stored in different folders.
